### Dependencies
* No dependencies

### Projects
* V - Main functionality
* VExp - Usage samples

### Setup
* Download repository
* Open V.sln in Visual Studio (i'm using 2017 Community version but 2013 and 2015 should work too)

* V.dll is now ready to be added as reference in your projects

### Future
* Tests
* Documentation
