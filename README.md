# V
Yet another, reinvented, multidimensional Vector library designed for work with changing dimensionality.

### Requirements
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1 (Most likely works on older versions, potential TODO)

* NUnit Test Adapter 3.9.0.0 (extension for test execution in Visual Studio used only in VTest project)

### Projects
* V - Main functionality
* VExp - Usage samples
* VTest - Tests

### Setup
* Download repository
* Open V.sln in Visual Studio (i'm using 2017 Community version but 2013 and 2015 should work too)
* Build project V (check project properties for output path, most likely ./bin/Debug/)
* V.dll is now ready to be added as reference in your projects

### Future
* Documentation
* In-depth samples and usage examples
